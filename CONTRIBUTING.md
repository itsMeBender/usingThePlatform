# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to the mesh or scene.

> Currently the project has finished; *Bender using the platform*.

I have no intention to change, add or enhance the Blender Mesh object. The Blender Bender 3D mesh, was the result of a [3D animation course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/learn/v4/overview). 
The original plan was to create Bender for 3D-print. Which I did and succeed.  
I reused this object to create a wall paper, when I was working on Polymer projects.

Probably GitHub is not the tool to manage Blender objects. But it`s part of the 'Hi itsMeBender' GitHub profile.

Things to tweak;

* I want to use marble as a texture. But texturing is a difficult process, which I do not master yet. Maybe YOU can make the scene more vibrant.

Happy rendering.
