# Bender 'usingThePlatform'

When working on Polymer projects, you see the phrase "#usetheplatform' used by Google.
Meaning, the web browser (Chrome) is becomming a application platform. 

Doing on some 3D artwork with [Blender render](https://www.blender.org/features/) and some Polymer projects.
I had the idea to combine these two. In, Bender using Blender to render #usetheplatform. 
And keep it for a while as my desktop wallpaper.
